Linking JXR Files to Javadocs

 To link the generated JXR files to the Javadocs, you need to set the following JXR Plugin configuration in your <<<pom.xml>>>:

+-----+
<project>
  ...
  <reporting>
    <plugins>
      ...
      <plugin>
        <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
        <artifactId>maven-jxr-plugin</artifactId>
        <version>${project.version}</version>
        <configuration>
          ...
          <linkJavadoc>true</linkJavadoc>
          <javadocDir>/path/to/javadocs</javadocDir>
          ...
        </configuration>
      </plugin>
    </plugins>
  ...
  </reporting>
  ...
</project>
+-----+

 The generated JXR pages will have a link named "View Javadoc" that will display the Javadoc of the class. In case there
 were no existing Javadocs in the specified Javadoc directory and no Javadocs will be generated (meaning no Javadoc Plugin
 configuration in the reporting section of the POM), the link will not be displayed even if the <<<linkJavadoc>>> parameter
 is set to <<<true>>>.

 Take note that if the <<<destDir>>> parameter is set in the Javadoc Plugin configuration, you need to also set the <<<javadocDir>>>
 parameter of the JXR Plugin to the same directory.
