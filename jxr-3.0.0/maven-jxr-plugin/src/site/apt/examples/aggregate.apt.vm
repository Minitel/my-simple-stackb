Aggregating JXR Reports for Multi-module Projects

 The <<<aggregate>>> parameter of the JXR Plugin can be used to generate JXR files for multi-module projects. Using this parameter,
 you can opt to generate one compiled set of JXR files for the whole project (all modules) or generate one set of JXR files for
 each module.

 For example, you have the following directory structure:

+-----+
Project
|-- pom.xml
|-- Module1
|   |-- src
|   |   `-- main
|   |       `-- java
|   |           `-- com
|   |               `-- module1
|   |                   `-- app
|   |                       `-- Module1App.java
|   `-- pom.xml
|-- Module2
|   |-- src
|   |   `-- main
|   |       `-- java
|   |           `-- com
|   |               `-- module2
|   |                   `-- app
|   |                       `-- Module2App.java
|   `-- pom.xml
`-- Module3
    |-- src
    |   `-- main
    |       `-- java
    |           `-- com
    |               `-- module3
    |                   `-- app
    |                       `-- Module3App.java
    `-- pom.xml
+-----+

 And you have the following configuration in your <<<pom.xml>>>:

+-----+
<project>
  ...
  <reporting>
    <plugins>
      <plugin>
        <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
        <artifactId>maven-jxr-plugin</artifactId>
        <version>${project.version}</version>
         <reportSets>
            <reportSet>
              <id>aggregate</id>
              <reports>
              <report>aggregate</report>
              <report>test-aggregate</report>
             </reports>
            </reportSet>
           </reportSets>
       </plugin>
    </plugins>
  ...
  </reporting>
  ...
</project>
+-----+

 When you execute <<<mvn site>>> from the parent directory, which is <Project>, a set of JXR files will be created
 in the target directory of <Project> where all of the JXR files of the project's submodules are included. 
 Otherwise a set of JXR files for <Module1> will be generated in the target directory of
 <Module1>, another set of JXR files for <Module2> will be generated in the target directory of <Module2>, and so on.
